# This is part of the way for project euler problem 4, and checks if a number is a palindrome

# 1 := Palindrome | 0 := Not Palindrome

# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the
# product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
